# RL and Info Theory
Code for running experiments associated with our paper: [State Abstraction as Compression in Apprenticeship Learning](https://david-abel.github.io/papers/rlit_aaai_2019.pdf), by David Abel, Dilip Arumugam, Kavosh Asadi, Yuu Jinnai, Michael L. Littman, and Lawson L.S. Wong (AAAI 2019).

To reproduce Figure 3a and 3b, run info_sa.py with exp_type = "plot_info_sa_val_and_num_states" in main. Then run plot_info_sa.py

To remake abstractions like the ones visualized in Figure 4b, 4c, and 4d, run info_sa.py with exp_type = "visualize_info_sa_abstr".

To reproduce Figure 5a, run deep/run_db.py

Please contact Dave with any questions (david_abel@brown.edu).
